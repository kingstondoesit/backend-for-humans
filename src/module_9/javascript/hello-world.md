# Hello World program in JavaScript

In this section, we are going to install the NodeJs and write a basic program
that prints "Hello World!"

## What is an "Hello World" program ?

Put simple, it is writing a program that prints "Hello world" (or "Hello,
world!"). It's like some sort of ritual in the board programming community to
welcome yourself; just like a baby's first cry.

## Installing the JavaScript programming language toolchain.

See this video on the installation guide and everything you need to know about
using the Rust programming language.
