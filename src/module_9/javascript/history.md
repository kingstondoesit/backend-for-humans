# History of JavaScript

JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape
Communications Corporation. It was originally called Mocha, then LiveScript,
before finally being named JavaScript to capitalize on the popularity of Java at
the time.

Not until the release of [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org), (discussed shortly),
in 2009. JavaScript is used predominantly (if not entirely ) in a browser

However, in 2009, Ryan Dahl, created something that has since changed the fate
of JavaScript. This tool is called NodeJs. NodeJs makes it possible for us to
use JavaScript for virtually anything.

In 2010, [npm](https://npmjs.org)[^note], this makes it possible to use other
people's code which they give out freely (Open Source Codes), thus increasing
the strength of the JavaScript community.

Other important things to note are:

1. Introduction of TYpescript
2. Electron
3. React Native
4. React 
5. ExpressJs 
7. Deno
8. Bun 


The Bottom line is, JavaScript has been around for almost three decades and, a number of dictators have tried to overthrow it (pun intended). I don't think it would be going anywhere anytime soon, especially with it increasing adoption
