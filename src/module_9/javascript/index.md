# JavaScript

JavaScript, often referred to as the language of the web, is a dynamically
[typed programming language](../../module_8/index.html#dynamically-typed-languages)
that has been widely used over the years, primarily for building web application
frontends.

However, it has evolved to support various other use cases, including backend
development, mobile applications, machine learning, task automation, and
[scripting](../../module_5/scripts/anatomy.md).
