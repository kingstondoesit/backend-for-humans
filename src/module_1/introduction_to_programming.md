## What is computer programming?

Broadly, computer programming is telling a computer exactly what to do. This is
done using a step-by-step, using special words, signs and symbols called
**code**

Itâ€™s like giving the computer a recipe so it knows how to make something happen.

This special set of words, signs and symbols is  otherwise known as computer
**programming language** which would be explored in detail in subsequent
modules.
