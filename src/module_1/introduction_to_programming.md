Computer programming is like telling a computer exactly what to do, step by
step, using special words, signs and symbols called "code."

Itâ€™s like giving the computer a recipe so it knows how to make something happen,
like showing a picture, playing a sound, or solving a math problem.

This special set of words, signs and symbols is what makes up the programming
language which we will explore in the next module and through out the rest of
the document.
