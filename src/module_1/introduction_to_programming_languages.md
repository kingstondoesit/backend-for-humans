Programming language is a system of notation that uses special sign, keywords,
symbols and notation to write computer programs

> [!Tip]
> Computer programs, as discussed in the previous module, is an instruction passed to a computer to carry out a task

To further comprehend this, think about the natural languages like English,
Russian, Spanish, and many more. The ability to **speak** English, Russian or
Spanish help you connect with someone in the United States, purchase something
from a seller in Saint Petersburg, Russia, or study in Universitat de Barcelona,
as long as you can clearly communicate and understand them.

In the same manner, the ability to speak **programming language** is a
prerequisite for telling computers what to do and getting a response.
