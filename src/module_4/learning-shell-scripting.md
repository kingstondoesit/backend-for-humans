# Learning Shell scripting

## What is Shell Scripting?

Shells are interactive, accepting commands from the user, typically through the
keyboard. For routine tasks, this becomes a very difficult thing to do, thus the
scripts are saved in files and passed to the Command Line Interpreter. This is
Shell scripting.
