# Learning Shell scripting

## What is Shell Scripting?

Shells are interactive, accepting commands from the user, typically through the
keyboard. For routine tasks, this becomes a very difficult thing to do, thus the
scripts are saved in files and passed to the Command Line Interpreter. This is
Shell scripting.

To begin;

1. create a folder at the desktop, call it `workspace`, ensure to use lowercase
   all through
2. For Windows user, left click on the newly created folder and select
   `Git Bash here`

   For Linux or MacOS users, also left click on the newly created `workspace`
   folder and select `terminal at folder` or similar
