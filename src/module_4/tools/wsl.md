In the [last module](../../module_3/common_operating_systems.md) we learnt about
operating system and we established the Linux, Mac and the Windows operating
systems as the major operating platforms for desktop environment. The Linux and
macOS are also known and referred to as the Unix-based operating system

The goal of WSL is the enable Windows user to use their laptops in a way that is
originally exclusive to Unix-based operating system users.
