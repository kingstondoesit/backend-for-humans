# echo

The `echo` command is used to print text in your terminal.

```sh
echo "Hello, World"
```

![echo](../../assets/shell-scripting/echo.png)

Note that the string to be printed here is "Hello world".

If it is a single world, like `hello`, you can safely ignore the quotation marks.

```sh
echo hello
```
