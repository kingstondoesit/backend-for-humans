# touch

The touch command is used to create files. To create files in the current
folder, provide the file name and file extension.

Let's create a `sample.txt` file.

```sh
touch sample.txt
```

![pwd](../../assets/shell-scripting/touch.png)

To create multiple files, add a space between the file names.

```sh
touch info.txt profile.txt interest.txt
```

![pwd](../../assets/shell-scripting/touch-multiple.png)
