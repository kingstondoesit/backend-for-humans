# Shell commands

Shell commands are special words you pass to the command line interface to
perform some task, for instance the command `mkdir` is used to create directory,
`ls` is used to list content of a folder, `cat` is used to print the content of
a text file. In the next few pages, out focus will be on trying out these
commands.
