# Introduction to Operating Systems

In the previous modules, I have tried to establish that, Computers, irrespective
of the form they appear (laptop, desktop, mobile...) or what they are used for
(gaming, video editing, software development...); they don't do anything exactly
magical!

To speak plainly, they're more or less a lump of plastic, and metals, and
electronics circuitry, powered by mind-boggling logic encoded as a form of a
program.

I'd like to also established that, the programs we writes make it possible to
achieve almost any feat, as as much as we can think it, we probably can code it.

It will suffice to say that, these program we write or develop are managed my an
"house keeper" present on the computer. The house keeper does all the heavy
lifting, of gluing our program unto the electronics hardware. It helps our
computer understand what we want. This house keeper is also a kind of software,
called **Operating System**

In this module, you will learn about different kinds of Operating systems, along
side some other interesting concepts.

1. Explain Operating system in your own words
2. Describe systems programming
3. Give examples of Operating systems
