# Introduction to Operating Systems

In the previous modules, I have tried to establish that, Computers, irrespective
of the form they appear (laptop, desktop, mobile...) or what they are used for
(gaming, video editing, software development...); they don't do anything exactly
magical!

To speak plainly, they're more or less a lump of plastic, and metals, and
electronics circuitry(henceforth called the **hardware**), powered by
mind-boggling logic encoded as a form of a program.

I'd like to also established that, the software we write makes it possible to
achieve almost any feat, as as much as we can think it, we probably can code it
and make it work.

It will suffice to say that, these software we develope are managed on the
target device by an **house keeper** present on that device. Although, this is
not the case, on some devices. That said, I will like to establish that, this
**house keeper** does all the heavy lifting of gluing our program unto the
electronics hardware. It helps our computer understand what we want. This house
keeper is also a kind of software, called **the Operating System**

Operating systems is a board topic on its own. In this module, you will learn
the basics sufficient to carry you through the remainder of the material.

## Learning expectation

At the end of this module, you should the able to

1. Explain Operating system in your own words
2. Describe systems programming
3. Give examples of Operating systems

## Learning Requirement

No additional requirements is required for this module
