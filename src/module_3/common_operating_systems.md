# Common Operating systems

As of the time of this writing, there are 2 major kinds of operating systems for
mobile devices, the [Android Operating system](https://source.android.com/) and
the [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS). However, we won't be discussing
them because our focus is on the desktop/laptop environment.

On laptop environment, we have a three major Operating Systems
[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux),
[macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) and
[Windows](https://www.prepbytes.com/blog/operating-system/windows-operating-system/)
operating systems. There are also some relatively unpopular ones, like
[Google's Chrome OS](https://chromeos.google/), [nixOS](https://nixos.org/),
[Redox OS](https://www.redox-os.org/), and probably a _zillion_ more.

## Linux

The linux isn't a kind of operating system, rather, it is a family of operating
systems, think of it as a fruit basket, the content of this basket is called
**distro**, a fancy word for **distribution**, Popular Linux distros include
Ubuntu, Kali, ParrotOS, Cent, Suse, and Fedora. They all have their strengths
and preferred use cases, for instances, Ubuntu is often used to run
servers, robots and Software development, while ParrotOS and Kali are used for
penetration testing otherwise known as hacking. Explaining the distro is beyond
the scope of this book, you can surf the internet for more.

## The mac Operating system

macOS is an open source software owned by Apple, it powers the apple laptops

## Windows Operating system

The Windows operating system is a closed source --- proprietary software, owned,
managed and distribute by Microsoft.
