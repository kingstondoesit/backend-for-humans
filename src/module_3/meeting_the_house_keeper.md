On an average computer, there are several software packages, by this, I mean
likes of **Apple store**, **Safari**, **Slack**, **Spotify**, etc as seen in the
picture. These packages cannot just work out of the box, without the operating
system which manages the processes, and other important softwares like a _boot
loader_[^boot], that helps in starting the computer, there would be no way they
cannot be downloaded or used without the Operating system. The Operating system
make all the awesomeness come to live. There's a lot more technical detail to
this, feel free to do some reading to suit your interest.

The operating system is the most important software a computer runs, it manages
the computer hardware, software, memory and processes[^os] You can't see it like
every other software package that you use, but it lives there, working beneath
them all. The operating system belongs to a category of software called **System
software**, the other category entails all forms of software which you have seen
and interacted with daily, as a convectional Computer user, this category is
called **Application software**.

Other examples of system softwares are Compilers and interpreters[^compilers]
which was introduced in module one

The application software would mean the myriads of tools we use everyday, like
Internet browser, word processors, image viewer.

the Operating System
