# Module review

In this module we learnt about how to put your script in a file and run them,
rather than input them from the keyboard as seen in module 4. We also talked
about making your Shell script and executable and other notable concepts like
array, conditional evaluation, for loops and reading shell script.

In the next module we will be learning another technology - HTML, feel free to
skip this module if you're familiar with frontend web development.
