# Writing shell scripts

In [module 4](../module_4/index.md) we explored common shell commands, and
manipulated folders and files and directories with the commands amongst other
things. This module will build on the previous knowledge from that module. You
might need to review [module 4](../module_4/index.md) if you're starting with
this.

## Learning expectation

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. explain what a shell interpreter is
2. write and execute a shell script from a file
3. make a shell script an executable
4. read a shell file and explain what it is supposed to do.

## Learning requirement

For this module, you need:

1. Vscode
2. Windows Subsystem for Linux (only for Windows user)

See the [setup instructions from module 4](./../module_4/tools/index.md)
