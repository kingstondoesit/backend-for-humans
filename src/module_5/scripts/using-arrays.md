# Using arrays

Arrays are a special type of containers to hold multiple values at this same
time. For instance, the rainbow is made of 7 colors. The array to make a
variable that would hold all the colors of the rainbow.

As an example

```sh
{{#include ../../code-samples/module_5/shell-array}}
```

Put this in a file `arr`, make it and executable and run, this would give:

```sh
red orange yellow green blue indigo violet
```
