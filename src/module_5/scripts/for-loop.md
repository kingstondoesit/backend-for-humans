# Using for loop

The `for` loop as seen in many programming languages, is often used to go over a
collection or a list of items and carry out an action, four ingredients are
required to use a for loop in Bash, `for`, `in`, `do`, and `done`. Consider the
array of rainbows colors we mention earlier while learning arrays?



```sh
{{#include ../../code-samples/module_5/shell-array}}
```


We can use use a for loop to print these colors thus 

```sh
{{#include ../../code-samples/module_5/shell-for-loop}}
```
