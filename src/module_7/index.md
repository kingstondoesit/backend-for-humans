# Introduction backend development

This coursework is focused on building "backend" applications, It is sufficient
to explain what that means, and a very popular analogy is the restaurant
analogy.

Consider a modern restaurant, there's the sitting area, the waiter or waitress,
and a kitchen, often the kitchen would have some kind of back-office or store
where things are kept.

In a like manner, an application or a piece of software is composed of three
major layers, the presentation layer (frontend), the business logic (backend),
and the persistence layer (database).

The presentation layer is formally known as the frontend, this can be a mobile
application, a web application, a desktop application or even a Command Line
application. The purpose of the frontend is to abstract away the wiring of the
system and make it cognitive and understandable for end-users.

The backend is where all the heavy lifting happens; where the user's request are
understood, validated, and processed. Usually the backend would need to interact
with some kind of stored data

In between the backend and the frontend, we have API's (Application Programming
Interface) which serves as the pipeline connecting the application core
(backend) to what the users see -- the frontend.

As a backend engineer, your duties would be to build the application core using
any programming language you are most convenient with or with the one your team
uses or the one your team lead specifies. Part of yor job is also deciding how
the frontend would consume the available data.

With this, we have come to the end of the preliminary concepts. In the next
section, we will focus on programming, from choosing a programming language to
doing some tasks and petty projects.
