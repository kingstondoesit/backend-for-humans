The internet as we know is today began in the 1960s [^note] as a research
project, aimed at ease of sharing information from one computer to the other.
The internet has since evolved to what we have today.

The internet is a probably simpler than you think, it is not a owned by someone
or some organization. Remember we discussed computers in the first module of
this book? For a refresher, computers are electronic devices, we see them
commonly as phones, laptop, smartwatch, servers, and many more forms. That said,
these devices (phone, laptops, servers) are able to talk to each other and share
information. The concept of computer communication is the internet. In other
words, the internet is the networking of computers.
